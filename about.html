  <h2>Chicago Homicide Trends</h2>

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Overview</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    This narrative visualization follows a martini glass hybrid structure for interactive storytelling.  It uses scenes, annotations, parameters, and triggers to tell the story and is implemented on the publicly visible website, GitHub.  The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using D3 can be found at the <a href = "https://github.com/mlsayers/ChicagoHomicideTrends/">GitHub Repository</a>. To view the visualization, use the <a href = "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mlsayers/ChicagoHomicideTrends/blob/master/index.html/">GitHub Preview Page</a>. </p>
    <p>Data was obtained from the <a href = "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/">Chicago Data Portal</a>.  Inspiration for the interactivity of the chart came from <a href = "http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967/">Mike Bostock's "Stacked-to-Grouped Bars"</a> and <a href = "http://vallandingham.me/stepper_steps.html/">Jim Vallandingham's "Steps for Building a Stepper Visualization"</a>.

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Martini Glass Structure</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    The martini glass hybrid structure is followed in this narrative visualization. The first four scenes direct the reader's attention using annotations and changes in the bar chart to highlight important points about the number and location of reported homicides. The reader is able to transition through the first four scenes following the story. The fifth scene allows the reader to explore the dataset and visualization further on their own. The radio buttons that appear to the right of the chart in scene 5 allow the reader to explore the dataset. These buttons allow the reader to change the stacked and grouped bar layout as well as change the y axis to better see trends in homicide locations over time. In this last scene, the reader is able to explore further than scenes 1-4. An annotation in scene 5 also draws the readerâ€™s attention to their ability to hover over the bars in the bar chart with their mouse to get the exact number of homicides for each location type and year.
  </p>

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Scenes</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    There are five scenes in the visualization that follow an order from 1 to 5 in conveying a message.  The scenes are navigated by selecting the numbers 1-5 at the top of the chart below the word "Scenes."  Numbers are used to cue the reader that the scenes are navigated in a linear order.
   </p>
   <p style = "font-size : 16px">
     The scenes follow a template for visual consistency.  This template is a bar chart with the title, x-axis, and colors remaining the same as the scenes are changed.  D3 transitions between scenes allow the reader to see the bars changing and keep the reader oriented.
   </p>

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Annotations</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    The annotations used in the narrative visualization follow a template for visual consistency.  The font and size of the annotation text stays the same as the reader transitions through the scenes.  All the annotations use transitions to keep their appearance less harsh to the reader as they appear.
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    In scene 1, annotations are used to highlight trends in the total number of homicides in Chicago over time. The annotation to the lower left labeled "Drop in Numbers" indicates a drop in the total number of homicides from 2002 to 2004 that lasted for over a decade. The placement of the annotation is next to where the change occurred to orient the reader's eyes to where the drop is. The annotation in the upper right labeled "Rise in Numbers" indicates a rise in the total number of homicides in 2016. The placement of the annotation is again next to where the change occurs to orient the reader. Exact numbers for the total number of homicides were not annotated on this scene as the falls and rises indicated are large enough that exact numbers were not needed to convey the message. The annotations appear when scene 1 is selected and disappear when any other scene is selected. They disappear to allow the reader to transition from total numbers in scene 1 to specific locations in scene 2.
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    In scene 2, one annotation is used to highlight the important points about street homicides as well as alert the reader about what to look for in scenes 3 and 4.  The title "Street Violence" is used to cue the reader that the street location had a big impact.  In most cases, the bars for the street location are twice as tall as the next highest bar making them stand out to the reader.  The street location bars not only stand out because of their size but they are also the closest bars to the annotation orienting the reader to them.  The annotation is centered at the top of the chart as the reader is meant to scan across the top of the highest bars (street).
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    This annotation also notifies the reader of what to look for in the next two scenes (3 and 4).  The reader will see that while residence and auto homicides increase in 2016, these rises are still below 2001-2003 numbers.  The annotation ends by leaving the reader with a major takeaway about street violence.  The annotation on this scene appears when scene 2 is selected and disappears when any other scene is selected.  It disappears to clear the chart of extra wording so the reader can focus on the change in the y axis.  This allows the reader to follow the trends in residence homicides on scene 3 and auto homicides on scene 4.
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    In scene 5, one annotation is used to orient the reader to the interactivity of the last scene in the martini glass structure.  This annotation informs the reader that there are now radio buttons to the right of the chart that allow the reader to explore the dataset further.  The annotation also informs the reader that they have the ability to hover over the bars in the chart to get exact values.  This annotation is cleared as the reader changes radio buttons so the text does not distract nor get in the way of exploration.
  </p>

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Parameters</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    Parameters in the visualization change as the reader navigates through the scenes. From scene 1 to scene 2, the chart changes from a stacked bar chart to a grouped bar chart. In addition, the y axis changes from the maximum value of the stacked bar chart to the maximum value of the grouped bar chart. From scene 2 to scene 3, the y axis changes from the maximum number of annual street homicides to the maximum number of annual residence homicides. From scene 3 to scene 4, the y axis changes from maximum annual residence to auto homicides. From scene 4 to scene 5, the y axis changes from the maximum annual auto homicides back to the maximum value of the stacked bar chart. The chart also changes back from a grouped to a stacked bar chart.
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    In scene 5 radio buttons appear to the right of the chart that were hidden up to this point. The parameters that change between radio button clicks are similar the parameters that changed from scenes 1-4. The chart changes from stacked to grouped, and the y axis changes to zoom the reader to different homicide locations.
  </p>

  <h3 style = "font-size : 18px">Triggers</h3>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    Triggers are used to change scenes and their associated parameters in the visualization.  At the top of the visualization, the reader clicks on the scene number to change scenes.  The word "Scenes" is written above the scene numbers as an indicator to the reader that the visualization is interactive.  Scenes is a commonly used word to indicate there is a change in what you will see.  The active scene number is highlighted dark green and the other numbers will highlight a light green when hovered over with the mouse to indicate they can be clicked.
  </p>
  <p style = "font-size : 16px">
    In scene 5, an annotation appears telling the reader that radio buttons are available to the right of the chart for further interactivity.  Radio buttons are a commonly used item indicating that only one item can be clicked at a time and can be activated by clicking on the radio button circle.  The reader has learned what to expect from the radio buttons as they perform the same types of actions that the reader has learned in scenes 1-4.  They can use the radio buttons to change from stacked to grouped and change the y axis to get a more detailed look at different locations.
  </p style = "font-size : 16px">
    The annotation on scene 5 also indicates that exact numbers for the bars can be triggered to appear by hovering over the bars.
