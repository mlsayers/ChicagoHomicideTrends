  <!--Title and Question-->
  <h1>Chicago Homicide Trends</h1>

  <h2>Overall</h2>
  <p>
    This narrative visualization follows a martini glass structure.  It is
    implemented on the publicly visible website, GitHub.  The URL for this
    is ___.
    Use the charts from your Midterm Project dashboard to create a narrative
    visualization, using your knowledge of visual communication and narrative
    structure, along with your skills at D3 programming in JavaScript. The
    narrative visualization should be implemented on a publicly visible website,
    such as Heroku. You will turn in this project by submitting the URL to the
    narrative visualization for peer grading.
  </p>
  <p>
    The narrative visualization should follow one of the three hybrid structures:
    a martini glass, an interactive slideshow, or a drill down story. The
    narrative visualization should be built with scenes, annotations, parameters,
    and triggers. The scenes should follow a template for visual consistency,
    follow an order to best convey the message, and the essay should also discuss
    the layout and any visual structure in these scenes. The annotations should
    follow a template for visual consistency, should highlight specific data items
    or trends, and the essay should indicate when they are cleared. The parameters
    should be identified in the essay, which should also discuss the states of the
    narrative visualization. The triggers should also be identified in the essay,
    in terms of the events and the parameter changes they trigger. User interface
    events should be listed, along with a description of how possible user events
    are communicated to the viewer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The opening scene should include a button, labeled “About the Visualization,”
    that presents an essay as described above that addresses the following points
    of the rubric for this assignment.
  </p>

  <h2>Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?</h2>
  <p>
    The narrative visualization correctly follows the hybrid structure stated in
    the essay.
  </p>
  <p>
    The narrative visualization follows a different structure than is stated in
    the essay, or the essay does not state the structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The narrative visualization is not properly deployed, and it is difficult to
    utilize at least one of the key components. The narrative visualization is
    not properly deployed, and is missing at least one key component (e.g., the
    reader-led exploration at the end of a martini glass structure).
  </p>

  <h2>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?</h2>
  <p>
    The essay properly discusses the layout and design of the scenes of the narrative visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the scenes of the narrative visualization adequately
    enough to determine appropriate application of layout and structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the scenes of the narrative visualization, or the
    scenes are not all based on the same template. The scenes are not properly
    ordered. One or more scenes is incomplete.
  </p>

  <h2>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?</h2>
  <p>
    The essay properly discusses the application of the annotations of the narrative
    visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the annotations of the narrative visualization
    adequately enough to determine when and why they are cleared between scenes,
    how they highlight data, or what template they follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the annotations of the narrative visualization, or
    the annotations do not follow the same template. The annotations are not
    properly applied. One or more annotations is incomplete.
  </p>

  <h2>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?</h2>
  <p>
    The essay properly discusses the parameters of the narrative visualization,
    including describing which parameters control the current state of the narrative visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the parameters of the narrative visualization
    adequately enough to determine appropriate use.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are errors in the narrative visualization due to the incorrect use of
    parameters. The narrative visualization is incomplete due to incomplete use
    of parameters.
  </p>


  <h2>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?</h2>
  <p>
    The essay properly discusses the triggers, including what user events trigger
    what parameter value changes, and how the viewer is aware of available user events.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the triggers adequately enough to determine the
    connection between user events and parameter value changes, or adequately
    enough to determine how available user events are communicated to the viewer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The essay does not discuss the triggers of the narrative visualization, or the
    available user events are not adequately communicated to the viewer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The triggers are not properly applied (e.g., a user event does not create the
    expected result). One or more triggers is incomplete.
  </p>
